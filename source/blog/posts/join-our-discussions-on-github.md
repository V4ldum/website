Jesse and I have been busy hacking on GitHub workflows to establish the technical infrastructure
for contributions and review. Thanks to a recommendation from a member of the community, we
believe we've chosen a direction that's tractable.

In the meantime, as we finalize the first iteration of contribution logistics, we've started
opening [discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/join-the-flock/nest/discussions).

We've already come across a couple questions that could use your feedback. We'd appreciate it
if you'd head over there and let us know what you think.

Moving forward, we'll post more questions and topics for public feedback under Discussions.
If you're interested in the future of Flock and Nest then we encourage you to bring your
Flutter needs and experiences to those discussions.
