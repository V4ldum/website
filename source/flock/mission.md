Flock is a fork of Flutter, intended as a pressure release valve for companies that depend upon Flutter.

Sometimes a company runs into a Flutter bug, or missing feature, which prevents the next app
release. When this happens, that company only has four options to deal with it:

 1. Wait for the Flutter team to merge a change.
 2. Use someone else's fork of Flutter that already has that change.
 3. Fork Flutter themselves, fix the issue, and then ship with their fork.
 4. Stop using Flutter.

The most harmful option is #4 - "stop using Flutter". When a company abandons Flutter, it eliminates
present-day Flutter jobs, future Flutter jobs, and may convince other companies to avoid Flutter.
The Flutter community should take all steps necessary to minimize the likelihood of Flutter
abandonment.

Option #1 - "wait for the Flutter team" - is fine, assuming that a company can wait. But if a
company can't wait, then that option is unworkable.

Flock, a fork of Flutter, facilitates option #2 - "use someone else's fork of Flutter". Flock
recruits great Flutter developers from the community to implement high-value blocking bug fixes
and features that the Flutter team can't, or won't implement.

A related project, called Nest, facilitates option #3 - "fork Flutter themselves".

To take advantage of Flock's bug fixes and features, please see the [Get Started](/flock/get-started)
guide.

To file a bug for Flock to fix, or a feature for Flock to implement, please see the [File an Issue](/flock/file-an-issue)
guide.

To efficiently fork Flutter, yourself, please see the tools available in [Nest](/nest)
